CNTK Installation and Setup the Environment
=============================================

.. .. _TensorFlow Installation: https://github.com/astorfi/TensorFlow-World/tree/master/docs/tutorials/installation

.. In order to install TensorFlow please refer to the following link:

  * `TensorFlow Installation`_


.. .. image:: _img/mainpage/installation.gif

.. The virtual environment installation is recommended in order to prevent package conflict and having the capacity to customize the working environment. The TensorFlow version employed for these tutorials is `1.1`. However, the files from previous versions can be transformed to newer versions (ex: version `1.1`) using the instructions available in the following link:

  * `Transitioning to TensorFlow 1.0 <https://www.tensorflow.org/install/migration/>`_
